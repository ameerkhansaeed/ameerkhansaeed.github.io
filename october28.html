        In terms of web design, I've already made some progress. Naturally, I faced some difficulties with it. Toggling between the light and dark themes was the first issue I ran into. I wanted my website to have a theme selection option once I finished the desktop design. And I started working on the dark theme. I was mistaken when I assumed that realizing it in practice would be simple. I spent roughly six hours figuring out the solution. It was difficult to make, but it's only a basic JavaScript function and button. The website now supports both light and dark themes. The user's preferences are remembered. If they were not set previously, the website uses system setting of the user. That's a big achievement for a beginner like me.

        Now I have another challenge: responsiveness. That is not going to be simple, in my opinion, after what I experienced yesterday. Anyways, it is important not to give up.
