        When I started building this website I did not think about responsiveness. I built it only for screens with the size of 1920x1080 px. But when I opened the site from a mobile device the structure was completely 'destroyed'. Everything was overlapping and even the logo was not showing correctly. Then I watched some videos on YouTube and read some articles about responsive design and finally was able to fix the problem. The structure is not perfect yet, but it's working for most of the devices.
        <br>
        <br>
        It turns out that I have to learn more about responsive design.
